For using Oni, you have two ways to choose.

1. Use Oni as a bukkit dependency and ask server owners to install it manually.
2. Use `OniBootstrap` to boot your plugin, download dependency, and solve problems.

The recommended way is second. However, only Gradle users can take this, or you have to write `oni.setting.json` by your
self. We're going to teach you how to use the second way right now. If you are willing to choose the first way, you can
skip this paragraph right now.
